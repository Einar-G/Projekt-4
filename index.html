            <h1 class="articleTitle">Welcome to The Complete CIV VI Guide</h1>
            <h2 class="articleText">Here I will teach you the basics of Civilization VI, but I'll also present some more advanced tips. This guide is primarly aimed towards newer players, however you might still learn something new even if you are experienced.</h2>
            <h2 class="articleText">I want to start with mentioning there is no correct way to play Civilization VI. There are ways that are more competetive and efficient, but if you think within a too rigid framework, a large part of the fun could be ruined. Try to decide how you want to play the game, and figure out what will work for you.</h2>
            <h1 class="articleTitle">Quick disclaimer</h1>
            <h2 class="articleText">This guide is made for CIV VI with all expansions, which would be Gathering Storm, Rise and Fall, New Frontier pass and the separate DLCs. Much of the information presented could be applied when playing without expansions, however not all of it, which is important to keep in mind.</h2>

            <h1 class="articleTitle">The different victory conditions</h1>
            <h2 class="articleText">There are several different victory conditions in CIV VI, all different in their own ways. The goal of the game is usually to achieve one of the victory conditions. Which victory condition you should work towards depends on which civilization you are, what situation you are in and naturally which one you want to achieve.</h2>
            <ul>
                <dt>Domination</dt>
                <dd>Domination is the most straight forward of the different victories. Capture every other civilizations capital, and you win the game. To achieve this you will need an army or navy, or perhaps both. When producing units there are many things than need to be factored in, such as:</dd>
                <ol>
                    <li>What terrain will you be fighting in?</li>
                    <li>Do you have any unique units?</li>
                    <li>Which strategic resources do you own?</li>
                    <li>What units does you opponents use? How can you counter them?</li>
                    <li>What will the unit upgrade into later?</li>                    
                </ol>
                <dd>Depending on the situation I'm facing, I'll adapt my army in different ways.</dd>

                <dt>Religious</dt>
                <dd>For a religous victory you are required to have atleast 50% of every other civilizations cities converted to you religion. So how do you achieve that? There are multiple ways to convert a city, the most plain and effective way is too use apostles and missionaries.</dd>
                <dd>When going for a religous victory holy sites are essential for your faith income. I usually aim for a quick religion by rushing a holy site in my capital and doing projects, to get a great prophet quicker. If you get an early religion, you have more alternatives for how you want to shape your religion. Usually work ethic is one of the best beliefs, as it can generate absurd amounts of production. That way you can skip constructing industrial zones, because you already have the production. It is also a good idea to try to get certain religous wonders such as hagia sophia, for more charges etc.</dd>
                <dt>Diplomatic</dt>
                <dd>To win a diplomatic victory you need 20 diplomatic victory points. You can get these from winning world congress resolutions, winning projects, and certain wonders. To win resolutions you need lots of diplomatic favor. To get this you should focus on good relations with other civilizations, many alliances, suzeranities with city states, and constructing a diplomatic quarter. Certain wonders, such as the Mahabodhi temple, and Statue of liberty give diplomatic victory points. These are important for getting a diplomatic victory.</dd>
                <dt>Scientific</dt>
                <dd>To win a scientific you need to launch all the space projects and get sufficient light years. To do this you need to have high science output, so you could reach the rquired technologies. To achieve this you should contstruct many campuses, and try to increase you science as much as possible. You'll also need a lot of production for the required projects. So having many industrial zones is also a priority for achieving a scientific victory.</dd>
                <dt>Cultural</dt>
                <dd>To win a cultural victory you need tourists. There are two types of tourist, domestic and international. The international tourists are the offense in a cultural victory. You can get these from wonders, high culture tiles and appeal, natural parks, great works, etc. You can also get important modifiers from alliances, trade routes, open borders, monopolies, and you goverrnment type.</dd>
                <dd>If you have more international tourists than every other civilizations domestic tourists you will win. Domestic tourists are an equivalent to all total culture generated by a civilizations.</dd>
                <dt>Score/Time</dt>
                <dd>Whoever has the most point when the turn limit is reached. You get points from, empire (which is population and land), great people, wonders, technology, civics, era score. You get a lot of score from, era score and wonders so these could be a priority should you ever aim for a score victory. Researching future techs repeadtely will also grants score.</dd>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="articleTitle">General information</h1>
            <h2 class="articleText">There are very many different civilizations all with different bonuses and playstyles. Naturally it is hard to balance every civilzation and certain civilizations are better than others. I will be analyzing 3 different civilizations and explain how they could be played effectively.</h2>
            <ul>
                <dt>Macedon</dt>
                <dd>Macedon is a civilization aimed towards compat and warfare. He recieves an unique swordsman and an unique horseman, both very powerful. He also recives an unique encampment, which provides science for each unit constructed in the city. His ability gives all his units full health when capturing a city with a wonder, and eurekas and inspirations if the city had holy sites or campuses.</dd>
                <dd>A domination victory is the condition Macedon is suited for. His army won't need to pause and heal if the conquered city has a wonder, which essentially mean you can steamroll civilizations by quickly rushing them and not giving them time to respond. You also get science from producing units, which compensates for only producing units, the eurakas and civics also help with this. When playing Macedon you should spam encampments, and then spam you unique units. Then you could conquer the world, and if that doesn't work out, you won't be too behind from constructing units instead of campuses, because of you unique barack. When playing Macedon focus on bronze working, iron working and horseback riding. The earlier you could start producing your unique units, the better.</dd>
                <dt>Korea</dt>
                <dd>Korea is a very strong scientific civilization. Your unique campus will produce a ton of science, and if you have many governors you will get a lot of bonus modifiers for science and culture. However Korea is such a strong civilization to play, you could usually go for every victory condition without being held back by you bonuses. When playing korea district placement is very important, because of your unique campus. You should avoid placing you campus close togehter with other districts, which goes against the tradition district placement. If you just make sure to place you campuses far away from other districts, you should be able to prosper.</dd>
                <dt>France</dt>
                <dd>France have different leaders which promote different playstyles. Catherine de medice either gets bonuses towards wonders, or towards spies. Eleanor of aquatine get a interesting loyalty mechanic. Either way all these leaders focus on culture and tourism, and when playing france you should aim for a culture victory. Constructing a lot of wonders will be a priority for the tourism output. Theather squares will also supply you with lots of culture if placed correct. Gaining great writers, musicians and artist will grant you great works. Which will provide tourism, and if playing Eleanor loyalty. Because of this you could pressure other civilizations cities to join yours, by placing many great works in cities close to theirs.</dd>
