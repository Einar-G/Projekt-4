            <h1 class="articleTitle">Welcome to The Complete CIV VI Guide</h1>
            <h2 class="articleText">Here I will teach you the basics of Civilization VI, but I'll also present some more advanced tips. This guide is primarly aimed towards newer players, however you might still learn something new even if you are experienced.</h2>
            <h2 class="articleText">I want to start with mentioning there is no correct way to play Civilization VI. There are ways that are more competetive and efficient, but if you think within a too rigid framework, a large part of the fun could be ruined. Try to decide how you want to play the game, and figure out what will work for you.</h2>
            <h1 class="articleTitle">Quick disclaimer</h1>
            <h2 class="articleText">This guide is made for CIV VI with all expansions, which would be Gathering Storm, Rise and Fall, New Frontier pass and the separate DLCs. Much of the information presented could be applied when playing without expansions, however not all of it, which is important to keep in mind.</h2>

            <h1 class="articleTitle">The different victory conditions</h1>
            <h2 class="articleText">There are several different victory conditions in CIV VI, all different in their own ways. The goal of the game is usually to achieve one of the victory conditions. Which victory condition you should work towards depends on which civilization you are, what situation you are in and naturally which one you want to achieve.</h2>
            <ul class ="conditions">
                <dt>Domination</dt>
                <dd>Domination is the most straight forward of the different victories. Capture every other civilizations capital, and you win the game. To achieve this you will need an army or navy, or perhaps both. When producing units there are many things than need to be factored in, such as:</dd>
                <ol>
                    <li>What terrain will you be fighting in?</li>
                    <li>Do you have any unique units?</li>
                    <li>Which strategic resources do you own?</li>
                    <li>What units does you opponents use? How can you counter them?</li>
                    <li>What will the unit upgrade into later?</li>                    
                </ol>
                <dd>Depending on the situation I'm facing I'll adapt my army in different ways.</dd>
