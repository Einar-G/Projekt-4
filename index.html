            <h1 class="articleTitle">Welcome to The Complete CIV VI Guide</h1>
            <h2 class="articleText">Here I will teach you the basics of Civilization VI, but I'll also present some more advanced tips. This guide is primarly aimed towards newer players, however you might still learn something new even if you are experienced.</h2>
            <h2 class="articleText">I want to start with mentioning there is no correct way to play Civilization VI. There are ways that are more competetive and efficient, but if you think within a too rigid framework, a large part of the fun could be ruined. Try to decide how you want to play the game, and figure out what will work for you.</h2>
            <h1 class="articleTitle">Quick disclaimer</h1>
            <h2 class="articleText">This guide is made for CIV VI with all expansions, which would be Gathering Storm, Rise and Fall, New Frontier pass and the separate DLCs. Much of the information presented could be applied when playing without expansions, however not all of it, which is important to keep in mind.</h2>

        <article id="victories" class="hidden">
            <h1 class="articleTitle">The different victory conditions</h1>
            <h2 class="articleText">There are several different victory conditions in CIV VI, all different in their own ways. The goal of the game is usually to achieve one of the victory conditions. Which victory condition you should work towards depends on which civilization you are, what situation you are in and naturally which one you want to achieve.</h2>
            <ul>
                <dt>Domination</dt>
                <dd>Domination is the most straight forward of the different victories. Capture every other civilizations capital, and you win the game. To achieve this you will need an army or navy, or perhaps both. When producing units there are many things than need to be factored in, such as:</dd>
                <ol>
                    <li>What terrain will you be fighting in?</li>
                    <li>Do you have any unique units?</li>
                    <li>Which strategic resources do you own?</li>
                    <li>What units does you opponents use? How can you counter them?</li>
                    <li>What will the unit upgrade into later?</li>                    
                </ol>
                <dd>Depending on the situation I'm facing, I'll adapt my army in different ways.</dd>

                <dt>Religious</dt>
                <dd>For a religous victory you are required to have atleast 50% of every other civilizations cities converted to you religion. So how do you achieve that? There are multiple ways to convert a city, the most plain and effective way is too use apostles and missionaries.</dd>
                <dd>When going for a religous victory holy sites are essential for your faith income. I usually aim for a quick religion by rushing a holy site in my capital and doing projects, to get a great prophet quicker. If you get an early religion, you have more alternatives for how you want to shape your religion. Usually work ethic is one of the best beliefs, as it can generate absurd amounts of production. That way you can skip constructing industrial zones, because you already have the production. It is also a good idea to try to get certain religous wonders such as hagia sophia, for more charges etc.</dd>
                <dt>Diplomatic</dt>
                <dd>To win a diplomatic victory you need 20 diplomatic victory points. You can get these from winning world congress resolutions, winning projects, and certain wonders. To win resolutions you need lots of diplomatic favor. To get this you should focus on good relations with other civilizations, many alliances, suzeranities with city states, and constructing a diplomatic quarter. Certain wonders, such as the Mahabodhi temple, and Statue of liberty give diplomatic victory points. These are important for getting a diplomatic victory.</dd>
                <dt>Scientific</dt>
                <dd>To win a scientific you need to launch all the space projects and get sufficient light years. To do this you need to have high science output, so you could reach the rquired technologies. To achieve this you should contstruct many campuses, and try to increase you science as much as possible. You'll also need a lot of production for the required projects. So having many industrial zones is also a priority for achieving a scientific victory.</dd>
                <dt>Cultural</dt>
                <dd>To win a cultural victory you need tourists. There are two types of tourist, domestic and international. The international tourists are the offense in a cultural victory. You can get these from wonders, high culture tiles and appeal, natural parks, great works, etc. You can also get important modifiers from alliances, trade routes, open borders, monopolies, and you goverrnment type.</dd>
                <dd>If you have more international tourists than every other civilizations domestic tourists you will win. Domestic tourists are an equivalent to all total culture generated by a civilizations.</dd>
                <dt>Score/Time</dt>
                <dd>Whoever has the most point when the turn limit is reached. You get points from, empire (which is population and land), great people, wonders, technology, civics, era score. You get a lot of score from, era score and wonders so these could be a priority should you ever aim for a score victory. Researching future techs repeadtely will also grants score.</dd>
            </ul>

        <article id="civilizations" class="hidden">
            <h1 class="articleTitle">General information</h1>
            <h2 class="articleText">There are very many different civilizations all with different bonuses and playstyles. Naturally it is hard to balance every civilzation and certain civilizations are better than others. I will be analyzing 3 different civilizations and explain how they could be played effectively.</h2>
            <ul>
                <section class = "imageContainer">
                    <dt>Macedon</dt>
                    <img src="macedon.png">
                </section>
                <dd>Macedon is a civilization aimed towards compat and warfare. He recieves an unique swordsman and an unique horseman, both very powerful. He also recives an unique encampment, which provides science for each unit constructed in the city. His ability gives all his units full health when capturing a city with a wonder, and eurekas and inspirations if the city had holy sites or campuses.</dd>
                <dd>A domination victory is the condition Macedon is suited for. His army won't need to pause and heal if the conquered city has a wonder, which essentially mean you can steamroll civilizations by quickly rushing them and not giving them time to respond. You also get science from producing units, which compensates for only producing units, the eurakas and civics also help with this. When playing Macedon you should spam encampments, and then spam you unique units. Then you could conquer the world, and if that doesn't work out, you won't be too behind from constructing units instead of campuses, because of you unique barack. When playing Macedon focus on bronze working, iron working and horseback riding. The earlier you could start producing your unique units, the better.</dd>
                <section class="imageContainer">
                    <dt>Korea</dt>
                    <img src="korea.png">
                </section>
                <dd>Korea is a very strong scientific civilization. Your unique campus will produce a ton of science, and if you have many governors you will get a lot of bonus modifiers for science and culture. However Korea is such a strong civilization to play, you could usually go for every victory condition without being held back by you bonuses. When playing korea district placement is very important, because of your unique campus. You should avoid placing you campus close togehter with other districts, which goes against the tradition district placement. If you just make sure to place you campuses far away from other districts, you should be able to prosper.</dd>
                <section class="imageContainer">
                    <dt>France</dt>
                    <img src="france.png">
                </section>         
                <dd>France have different leaders which promote different playstyles. Catherine de medice either gets bonuses towards wonders, or towards spies. Eleanor of aquatine get a interesting loyalty mechanic. Either way all these leaders focus on culture and tourism, and when playing france you should aim for a culture victory. Constructing a lot of wonders will be a priority for the tourism output. Theather squares will also supply you with lots of culture if placed correct. Gaining great writers, musicians and artist will grant you great works. Which will provide tourism, and if playing Eleanor loyalty. Because of this you could pressure other civilizations cities to join yours, by placing many great works in cities close to theirs.</dd>
            </ul>
        </article>
        <article id="districts" class="hidden">
            <h1 class ="articleTitle">Districts explained</h1>
            <h2 class ="articleText">There are many different disctrics in CIV VI, all with their different purposes. They can be splitted into two categories, specialty and enigineering. The specialty districs require population to be constructed. For every 3 pop you can place one more district. So a new district can be placed at 4, 7, 10, 13, etc pop, you get the idea. Enigineering districts main purpose is to give you more housing, but they can also be useful for adjacency and other abilities. They do not require population, like the specialty districts do.</h2>
            <ul>
                <dt>Holy site</dt>
                <dd>Holy sites are essential for faith output, and for a religion. They can give many bonuses if you get a early religion with strong beliefs. Many beleifs such as choral music, work ethic and holy sanctuaries provide such strong bonuses, they can become a game changer. Holy sites are also very easy to get high adjacency, with different pantheon provding more adjacency. I usually recomend to try to get a religion every game, however you are not required to.</dd>
                <dt>Campus</dt>
                <dd>Campuses yield science, which is very important for winning the game, no matter what victory condition you are striving for. They are almost a requirement for every game. Try to get as much adjacency as possible, since most of the science output will come from that.</dd>
                <dt>industrial zone</dt>
                <dd>industrial zones are interesting districts, where most of the adjacency will come from aqueducts and dams. Because of this you need to plan your district placement extra carefully when placing industrial zones. To get high production in the mid/late game you need to get atleast one/two industrial zones to boost you core cities. Always make sure to have the craftmanship policy card in your government aswell.</dd>
                <dt>Harbor</dt>
                <dd>Harbors are mostly used for housing, and food. They are also useful for trade and naval units.</dd>
                <dt>Commercial hub</dt>
                <dd>Commerical hubs are not very good in my opionion, unless you play with monopolies or secret societies. Then they can be very useful, because of the gilded vault, and the great merchant points. Otherwise I would recomend newer players to avoid building to many commercial hubs. Mali and Germany are excpetions, since they are very useful for them.</dd>
                <dt>Government plaza</dt>
                <dd>The government plaza is a very strong district. It will give you governor titles, which will be important, even more so if you play with secret societies. It will also give the adjacent districts extra adjacency. So placing it within proximity of other districts is a very good idea.</dd>
                <dt>Theather square</dt>
                <dd>Theather squares are used for culture and tourism output. Their adjacency rely on wonders, so trying to get some wonders close to eachother will be very useful for reaching high adjacency. They will also provide great writer, artist and musicians. With these you can get great works which will generate tourism.</dd>
                <dt>Encampment</dt>
                <dd>Encampments are usually most useful when defending. They are a fortress, and if you have walls in your city, the encampment will recieve it aswell. They will also give you bonuses when producing units, such as extra experience, and less production required. Usually I only build 1-2 encampments, just for extra defence.</dd>
                <dt>Aerodrome</dt>
                <dd>These are useful since they allow you to constrct aircrafts. And in CIV VIs late game aircrafts are op. Biplanes can take out units far away without much retaliation. Bombers can melt cities defenses and health. They are much stronger then artillery and other siege units, since they have unparallel movement abilites. If I'm going to warmonger in late game, I'll almost always construct aerodromes.</dd>
                <dt>Diplomatic quarter</dt>
                <dd>These are very boring, they can generate some diplomatic favor, and provide minor bonuses. Not very strong, and I usually don't construct them, unless I need diplomatic favor.</dd>
                <dt>Preserve</dt>
                <dd>Preserves are one of the most interesting districts in the game. If the adjacent tiles have breathtaking appeal and are unimproved, they will get faith, food, culture and science bonuses. Because of the preserve working best with high appeal uninproved tiles, they are very strongly paired with natural parks. I recoment everyone to try playing a game focusing on preserves, since it's very interesting and rewarding to play with them.</dd>
                <dt>Entertainment complex</dt>
                <dd>Entertainment compexes will give the city local ameneties, which is very strong. Since ameneties are essential for keeping your cities production and growth at it's highest potential. When constructing zoos the cities within 6 tiles will also recieve ameneties. Constructing these in the late game is very common, because amenity problems are going to become more widespread as population increase, and more cities are settled. I recomend placing one in you capital, since that is the city that will usually get the most benefit of having the happy/ecstatic bonus.</dd>
                <dt>Water park</dt>
                <dd>It is the same as entertainment complex, but it is placed on the water. This hase it's benefits and drawbacks. The good thing is that water tiles are usually less useful than land tiles, so by placing the district on the water, you don't waste a good tile. But the drawback is that usually less cities will get the benefit of extra amenities.</dd>
            </ul>

        <article id="wonders" class="hidden">
            <h1 class ="articleTitle">In CIV VI there are several different wonders</h1>
            <h2 class ="articleText">They are all unique in their own way and provide different bonuses and abilities. Naturally it is complicated to make every wonder balanced and certain wonders are bad, meanwhile other wonders are gamebreaking. I will not have time to rank every wonder so I'll instead link a very useful guide by PotatoMcWhiskey, that I strongly recomend wathing if you are intersted. <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mrm5Dfa4Yg0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></h2>
            <h2 class ="articleText">I will however explain some of my favourite wonders, that according to me also are some of the stronest ones.</h2>
            <ul>
                <dt>Petra</dt>
                <dd>Petra is a desert wonder that will give food, production and gold to all desert tiles, desert floodplains not included. This wonder can turn a worthless desert city into your strongest city with ease, especially if you have many hills, or an unique improvement.</dd>
                <dt>Eiffel tower</dt>
                <dd>I usually did not pay much attention to the eiffel tower. But after they added preserves it has become one of my favourites. The Eiffel tower adds two appeal to every tile in your empire, which usually means all of your tiles will become breathinaking, unless you have floodplains or something with horrible appeal. This appeal will become very overpowered when paired with natural parks, preserves and earth godess.</dd>
                <dt>Etemenanki</dt>
                <dd>Etemenanki is one of the newer wonders in CIV VI. And it's absolutely broken. It will makes all your marshes overpowered, and if you have flodplains in the city where it was constructed you will get lots of production and science in the early game, for almost no invesment. The etemenanki wonder is easily one of the strongest wonders in the game, partly because of how strong it is. But also because of how early you unlock it. A good rule of thumb is that the earlier something in the game is unlocked, it can be units, wonders, buildings, districts, etc. The more useful it will be. The early and mid game are the most important stages of the game, since it will have the largest impact on how the game ends.</dd>
